# Todo Application

## Project Description
The Todo Application is a simple yet effective task management tool designed to help users organize their daily tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and track their tasks with ease. Each task can be marked as completed or pending, providing a clear overview of what needs to be done. The application also maintains a persistent state by storing the tasks in the browser's local storage, ensuring that user data is not lost even after refreshing the page.

## Key Features
- **Add New Tasks**: Users can input new tasks into the application, which are assigned a unique identifier.
- **Edit Existing Tasks**: Users can modify their tasks, allowing for updates and changes as needed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list, with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletions.
- **Toggle Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed or pending, visually indicating progress.
- **Persistent Storage**: All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, enabling users to retain their data between sessions.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which allows for a component-based architecture and efficient rendering.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Modern JavaScript features are utilized for clean and concise code, enhancing readability and maintainability.
- **CSS**: Custom styles are applied using CSS for a visually appealing and responsive design.
- **FontAwesome**: Icons from FontAwesome are used to enhance the user interface, providing intuitive visual cues for editing and deleting tasks.
- **UUID**: The UUID library is employed to generate unique identifiers for each task, ensuring no conflicts arise when managing tasks.
